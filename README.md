# React.js-ReactRouter-Clothing-Brand-Website
This is a website for a fictitious clothing brand that I have created using React.js and React-Router. 
Attractively styled using CSS.

I created this site to demonstrate my abilities in using React.js and to show that I am able to build a complete and functional site that is reactive and attractively styled.

_**I am aware the styling on the landing page has a white bar above the footer. This was not present when running on my machine. Not sure why it has popped up in the deploy. I am looking into it and will fix the issue as soon as i find it**_

## Future Improvements:<a name="future-improvements"/>
   As this is a project I am continuously updating and improving, I aim to have the following improvements added to the website in the near future:
   - Functioning Shopping Cart with checkout.
   - Modals that pop up when a product is clicked. 
   - Sizes added to products. 
   - More functionality to the user login/user profile - to show current orders and historic orders and allow the user to update their details. 

   I will look to update more as I come across items that I believe need updating. Please feel free to let me know of any changes you believe may be beneficial.
