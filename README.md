This is an attractively styled website that I have built for a fictitious clothing brand. 
This website was created with React.js and CSS and makes use of React Router. 

The website is designed to showcase the brand's products and provide users with a seamless browsing experience. 
The website has several features, including:
   - Attractively styled pages.
   - Navigation bar and footer with working links to different pages.
   - Shopping page with a variety of products.
   - Finance page containing a functional interest calculator.
   - Basic user login page with a functional login/logout section.

5. Once this has finished installing, you can start the game by running the following in the command line -  **"npm start".**

6.This will usually automatically open a web browser and launch the program. However, you can open it yourself if you go to "http://localhost:3000" in a browser.
